<h1>Hello there! :joy_cat:</h1>

- 👋 Hi, I’m @AJarich. It's nice to meet you!
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development. I love finding better ways to become a better front-end developer. I spend my free time learning different languages like React.js or Tailwind CSS. I also like to create new projects to add to my portfolio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.js. It's a very useful language, with it's abilities to create components that can be used around the project and to update the state without having to reload the page.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on front-end web development projects like websites and emails.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email me at andreajarich@gmail.com.
- :dollar: Look for me on Fiverr at <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/perunwebdev?up_rollout=true">PerunWebDev</a> if you want me to work on your web development projects.
- :art: Hobbies: Reading, crocheting, working out, being outside.
- :woman: Pronouns: She/Her
- :sparkles: Fun Fact: I like to turn plastic bags into yarn and crocheting them into things like bags and birdhouses.
